# Interactive-Drum-Kit

This is an interactive drum kit - focusing on developing JavaScript fundamentals. 

I learned how to add event listeners to buttons and keystrokes for tapping or clicking. When the user clicks on the specific image of a drum they will hear the corresponding sound of that drum or they can choose to use the letter that is found on the image of the drum if they want to type on their keyboard instead. 

For user experience satisfaction, the image will flash white when selected. This is intended to be extra confirmation for the user, so they know the drum they selected is the correct drum that is being played.
